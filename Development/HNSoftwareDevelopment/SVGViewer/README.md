# SVGViewer

A Windows desktop application (C# / WPF, .NET 8) to **browse a drive, find SVG
files fast, and preview them** — with folders that contain SVGs clearly marked,
adjustable preview sizes, and one double‑click to open a file in your associated
editor (e.g. Inkscape). The interface is fully multilingual (Dutch, English,
German).

## Features

- **Drive & folder navigation** — pick a drive or a chosen folder and click through a tree view.
- **SVG folder highlighting** — folders that contain `.svg` files are marked so
  you can jump straight to them.
- **Persistent scan cache** — completed scans are available immediately the next
  time you open the same drive or folder.
- **Structure filter** — show the full folder tree, or only folders that contain
  SVG files.
- **Preview sizes** — Large, Medium, Small, or Only details (list view).
- **SVG‑only** — all non‑SVG files are hidden.
- **Edit externally** — double‑click an SVG to open it in the associated app.
- **Multilingual UI** — Dutch (default), English, German, switchable at runtime.
- **In‑app help** — user guide opens in the currently selected language.
- **Simple filemanagement** - rename, copy or move files from one directory to another on the selected drive, or to another drive when you have an open explorer window with that drive.
