December 16th, 2020

.NET 5.0 was released recently and has come with many new features and performance improvements. System.Text.Json is no exception. We have improved performance, reliability, and made it easier to adopt for people who are familiar with Newtonsoft.Json. In this post, I’m going to talk about the progress that has been made with System.Text.Json, and what’s going to come next.

Getting the library
If your project is targeting .NET 5, install .NET 5. This gives you System.Text.Json right out of the box, without any other pre-requisites.
If your project is targeting .NET Core 3.x or .NET Framework, or if you’re writing a .NET Standard compatible library, install the latest System.Text.Json NuGet package.
If you’re starting a new ASP.NET Core project or upgrading an existing one from ASP.NET Core 2.2 to 3.0 or 5.0, System.Text.Json is the default serialization library being used under the covers.
What is System.Text.Json?
System.Text.Json is the built-in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) serialization library in .NET for converting from .NET object types to a JSON string, and vice versa, supporting UTF-8 text encoding. It was first added in .NET Core 3.0. A popular type in the library is JsonSerializer, which provides the highest level of functionality for processing JSON data. Here’s a simple example of how to use it to serialize and deserialize JSON to and from .NET object types:

using System;
using System.Text.Json;

MyType obj = new() { Message = "Hello World!" };

string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(obj);
Console.WriteLine(json); // {"Message":"Hello World!"}

MyType anotherObject = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<MyType>("{"Message":"Hello Again."}");
Console.WriteLine(anotherObject.Message); // "Hello Again."

public class MyType
{
    public string Message { get; set; }
}
Why System.Text.Json? Looking back at .NET Core 3.x
Processing JSON data has become an essential part of many modern .NET applications, and in many cases, the format has even surpassed the usage of XML. However, .NET didn’t have a great built-in way to deal with JSON. Instead, users relied on Newtonsoft.Json, which continues to serve the .NET ecosystem well. It became clear that customers would benefit from a modern JSON library that came as part of the framework. Therefore, we built a new JSON library with the following considerations:

Provide high-performance JSON APIs. We needed a new set of JSON APIs that are highly tuned for performance, leverage modern additions to the framework like Span<T>, and can process UTF-8 directly without having to transcode to UTF-16 strings. These aspects are critical to ASP.NET Core, where throughput is a key requirement. We considered contributing changes to Newtonsoft.Json, but this was deemed infeasible without either breaking existing Newtonsoft.Json users or compromising on the performance we could achieve.
Remove the Newtonsoft.Json dependency from ASP.NET Core. Prior to .NET Core 3.x ASP.NET Core had a dependency on Newtonsoft.Json. While this provided a tight integration between ASP.NET Core and Newtonsoft.Json, it also meant that the version of Newtonsoft.Json was dictated by the underlying platform. However, Newtonsoft.Json was frequently updated and application developers often needed to use a specific version. Thus, we wanted to remove the Newtonsoft.Json dependency from ASP.NET Core 3.0, so that customers could choose which version to use, without fearing they might accidentally break the underlying platform.
Given the ubiquity of Newtonsoft.Json in the .NET ecosystem, we did not want to remove it as a dependency from ASP.NET Core without providing an easy way to add it back as the serialization mechanism. The way to do this is the following:

Install the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package.
Update Startup.ConfigureServices() to call AddNewtonsoftJson().
services.AddMvc()
    .AddNewtonsoftJson();
For more information, see Newtonsoft.Json (Json.NET) support.

What we shipped in .NET Core 3.0
In .NET Core 3.0, we shipped the following types in the System.Text.Json namespace:

JsonSerializer: Provides functionality to serialize .NET objects to JSON representations and to deserialize JSON into .NET objects.
JsonDocument: Provides random access capabilities for examining the structural content of a JSON value without automatically instantiating data values. This type is immutable.
JsonElement: Represents a specific JSON value within a JsonDocument.
Utf8JsonWriter: Provides a high-performance API for forward-only, non-cached writing of UTF-8 encoded JSON text.
Utf8JsonReader: Provides a high-performance API for forward-only, token-by-token processing of UTF-8 encoded JSON text.
In the System.Text.Json.Serialization namespace, we shipped attributes and APIs for advanced scenarios and customization specific to serialization and deserialization with JsonSerializer. Popular among these is the JsonConverter<T> type which allows users to control the serialization and deserialization of a specific type, property, or field.

JsonSerializer provides the highest level of functionality for processing JSON data. Due to the wide feature breadth of implementing a serializer to convert between a persistent data format and .NET object types, JsonSerializer is undergoing far more development and receiving more community feedback than the other types in the JSON stack. As a result, I’ll mostly cover JsonSerializer functionality in this post.

In 3.0, we shipped JsonSerializer with the following functionality:

Support for serializing and deserializing plain old CLR objects (POCOs), primitives, and collections
Built-in asynchronous serialization and deserialization
Native processing of UTF-8 data
Case-insensitive deserialization (in addition to case-sensitive)
Camel-case naming policy with JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase
Specifying custom naming policies with JsonNamingPolicy
Escaped JSON data deserialization
Optional minimal character escaping on serialization
Ignoring null values on serialization
Ignoring comments on deserialization
Allowing trailing commas
Custom converters
Indicating a property overflow bag when deserializing using [JsonExtensionData] attribute
Ignoring individual properties using [JsonIgnore] attribute
Specifying a custom property name using [JsonProperty] attribute
See JSON serialization and deserialization (marshalling and unmarshalling) in .NET for an overview of the functionality that System.Text.Json offers.

Choosing between System.Text.Json and Newtonsoft.Json
Feature differences
Now, you might be asking yourself, should I migrate from Newtonsoft.Json to use System.Text.Json? The answer, as you likely suspected is, it depends. In .NET Core 3.0, we made System.Text.Json the default serializer for ASP.NET Core because we believe it’s good enough for most applications. However, if you have heavily customized the serialization behavior by, for example, using several attributes from Newtonsoft.Json, you might find it more difficult to migrate as opposed to, say, someone who mostly uses POCOs. For more details, check out the documentation on How to migrate from Newtonsoft.Json to System.Text.Json.

System.Text.Json focuses primarily on performance, security, and standards compliance, given it’s the default JSON-processing stack for new .NET applications. It has some key differences in default behavior and doesn’t aim to have feature parity with Newtonsoft.Json. For some scenarios, System.Text.Json has no built-in functionality, but there are recommended workarounds. For other scenarios, workarounds are impractical. If your application depends on a missing feature, consider filing an issue to find out if support for your scenario can be added.

That’s not to say that System.Text.Json doesn’t have features or flexibility, or that Newtonsoft.Json is slow; it’s just meant to illustrate the different design philosophies and how we resolve tension when features are in conflict with either performance or flexibility. The goal we have for System.Text.Json is to provide a fast built-in JSON stack that balances performance, security, and feature set. Every feature request is carefully weighed against these design principles. This may mean that new projects that align with these principles may more readily use System.Text.Json, whereas older projects may encounter more roadblocks during migration. However, there is nothing wrong with Newtonsoft.Json. If you’re happy with it, you should continue to use it.

Let me provide two examples of features we don’t plan to add to System.Text.Json for the foreseeable future:

Type conversion via System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
Tweaking serialization behavior via System.Runtime.Serialization attributes
Both of these are considered legacy systems from older serialization stacks, and supporting them would go against the performance-first architecture of System.Text.Json due to additional reflection-based lookups on start-up, and bring the maintenance and size burden of more code in the System.Text.Json.dll. Additionally, any feature that implies going against our principle of standards compliance, such as allowing processing of malformed JSON on deserialization, will not be accepted.

We are designing System.Text.Json with extensibility in mind, meaning that even if the above features do not have native support within JsonSerializer, they can still be supported from user-provided configuration. For instance, users can write a wrapper around calls to TypeConverters by using a custom JsonConverter<T>. We are also considering IContractResolver and JsonProperty-like mechanisms (from Newtonsoft.Json) to allow programmatic control of setting metadata and serialization logic for types and members (dotnet/runtime #31257), which would allow custom support for honoring System.Runtime.Serialization attributes.

JsonSerializer supports asynchronous serialization and deserialization of JSON data as a built-in, performant feature. This has been shown to provide significant value to customers writing highly scalable applications that need to be responsive and non-blocking, over Newtonsoft.Json which doesn’t have a built-in mechanism to support async JSON processing.

The UTF-8 encoding is the de facto format for information transfer over the wire. System.Text.Json APIs natively process data with this encoding and do not need to transcode to and from UTF-16, unlike Newtonsoft.Json. Callers also do not need to manually transcode data before passing it as input to the System.Text.Json APIs. Avoiding this transcoding also helps yield better performance when processing JSON data. Note that string-based (UTF-16) APIs are also available as a convenience but incur the cost of transcoding.

Performance
During the .NET Core 3.0 development cycle, we blogged about how System.Text.Json performance compares with Newtonsoft.Json:

Scenario	Speed	Memory
Deserialization	2x faster	Parity or lower
Serialization	1.5x faster	Parity or lower
Document (read-only)	3-5x faster	~Allocation free for sizes < 1 MB
Reader	2-3x faster	~Allocation free (until you materialize values)
Writer	1.3-1.6x faster	~Allocation free
As it is with any performance benchmarks, scenarios vary, and summarizing numbers is nuanced. The summary of that post read:

The primary goal was performance and we see typical speedups of up to 2x over Json.NET, but it depends on your scenario and your payload, so make sure you measure what’s important to you.

Some people took this to mean that System.Text.Json is always twice as fast, which wasn’t the intended takeaway. The “up to” and “depends on your scenario and your payload” statements are key in that sentence.

There have been multiple performance comparisons between JsonSerializer and other serializers in the .NET ecosystem. You may have noticed that JsonSerializer is not always the fastest. You might wonder why that is when we have said that performance is a primary goal. In software, almost no capability can be maximized without hurting other capabilities, so all functionality is a trade-off between various aspects. And while performance of JSON serialization is very important to us, it’s not the only goal we have. Other goals include security, reliability, standards compliance, and usability.

Here are a few examples of some trade-offs we made against better performance:

Using classes in some cases. We made the decision to turn Utf8JsonWriter into a class. It used to be a ref struct which allowed for fewer allocations and faster access to the underlying span we’re writing to. We changed it to a class to avoid problems where developers accidentally create copies of the writer (for example, when passing it to a helper method by value) and subsequent writes end up overwriting data in the buffer.
Validation. We made the decision to validate JSON data when it’s being processed, which includes both UTF-8 validation as well as JSON syntax validation. This is necessary to enable server and cloud scenarios where the JSON input is often coming from untrusted sources.
Extension points. The serializer has the ability to register custom converters. These indirections, while relatively cheap, are costly when running in a tight loop; sometimes even when they aren’t used (due to lookups).
What’s new in .NET 5.0?
New features
In .NET 5.0, we have implemented some of the most sought after features from the community and made it easier to adopt for people who are familiar with Newtonsoft.Json. Here is an overview of the features that were added:

GitHub Issue	Description
#30820	Add mechanism to preserve object references when (de)serializing
#32937	Add extension methods for HttpClient and HttpContent that allow (de)serializing JSON
#30255	Support (de)serializing quoted numbers

#876	Support (de)serializing fields
#779	Support ignoring value-type defaults
#30687	Support conditionally ignoring properties (always, never, when null/default)
#30524	Support non-string dictionary keys
#29743	Allow using non-public property accessors for (de)serialization

#30445	Add a copy constructor to JsonSerializerOptions
#34626	Add constructor to JsonSerializerOptions that takes serialization defaults
#31326	Enable JsonSerializer to work on Xamarin iOS/Android
When we announced .NET 5.0 and .NET 5.0 RC 1, we went over some of the new features, including improved support for immutable types and preserving references in JSON object graphs. In this section, I will go over a few more.

Support for quoted numbers
When .NET Core 3.0 shipped, deserializing number types encoded as JSON strings was not supported by default. The workaround was to add a custom converter for each applicable number type which would take control of the serialization and deserialization of the type, and include logic to handle quoted numbers. In .NET 5, we have added a convenient, opt-in feature to support serializing and deserializing quoted numbers, and named floating point literals (NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity). Here is an example that uses this feature:

using System;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

var options = new JsonSerializerOptions
{
    NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.AllowReadingFromString | 
        JsonNumberHandling.WriteAsString
};

string json = @"{""NumberOne"":1,""NumberTwo"":""2""}";

ClassWithInts @class = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ClassWithInts>(json, options);
Console.WriteLine(@class.NumberOne); // 1
Console.WriteLine(@class.NumberTwo); // 2

json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(@class, options);
Console.WriteLine(json); // @"{""NumberOne"":""1"",""NumberTwo"":""2""}";

public class ClassWithInts
{
    public int NumberOne { get; set; }
    public int NumberTwo { get; set; }
}
In addition to the globally applied JsonSerializerOptions.NumberHandling option, we have also added JsonNumberHandlingAttribute which enables specifying number handling settings for a type, property, or field.

Extended support for ignoring default values
When serializing in .NET Core 3.x, it was only possible to ignore null values for reference or nullable value-typed properties, and the JsonSerializerOptions.IgnoreNullValues setting was only applicable across an entire input object graph. In .NET 5, we added support to ignore default values for non-nullable value types, such as int and float. Furthermore, it is now possible to cherry-pick properties and fields to be ignored when default. See the following example:

var options = new JsonSerializerOptions
{
    DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingDefault
};

var obj = new MyClass();
string json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(obj, options);
Console.WriteLine(json); // {"MyBool":false}

public class MyClass
{
    public int MyInt { get; set; }

    [JsonIgnore(Condition = JsonIgnoreCondition.Never)]
    public bool MyBool { get; set; }

    public string MyString { get; set; }
}
Here we see a combination of the new features: we tell the serializer to ignore default values across the entire object graph, but indicate that one of the properties should never be ignored, regardless of the global option. To only ignore null values, but not default values for value types, use JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull.

With these augmentations to handling default values, the JsonSerializerOptions.IgnoreNullValues property has been made obsolete in the upcoming .NET 6.0 release. IgnoreNullValues is honored when deserializing as well as when serializing. This is not desired, as there is no good reason for ignoring null tokens in input payloads.

Utility constructors for JsonSerializerOptions
Copying JsonSerializerOptions settings from one instance to another, then making a few mutations, is a common operation. In .NET 5, we added a copy constructor to JsonSerializerOptions which makes this easier:

JsonSerializerOptions options = new()
{
    NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.AllowReadingFromString,
    DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull,
    Converters = { new JsonStringEnumConverter() }
};

JsonSerializerOptions newOptions = new(options)
{
    NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.Strict
};

Console.WriteLine(newOptions.NumberHandling);
// Strict
Console.WriteLine(newOptions.DefaultIgnoreCondition);
// WhenWritingNull
Console.WriteLine(newOptions.Converters[0]);
// System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonStringEnumConverter
A common set of options when processing JSON data in web contexts is to use the camelCase naming policy, specify case-insensitive matching when deserializing, and allow reading quoted numbers. The new JsonSerializerDefaults.Web enum value, along with a new constructor that takes a JsonSerializerDefaults value, provides an easy way to reuse these options in a consistent way across multiple layers of an application, (e.g. client, shared, and server for Blazor scenarios). Let’s take a look:

JsonSerializerOptions options = new(JsonSerializerDefaults.Web);
Console.WriteLine(options.PropertyNamingPolicy);
// System.Text.Json.JsonCamelCaseNamingPolicy
Console.WriteLine(options.PropertyNameCaseInsensitive);
// True
Console.WriteLine(options.NumberHandling);
// AllowReadingFromString

Performance improvements
Between .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5, we have improved performance in the following areas:

Improved serialization and deserialization performance for collections
Improved serialization and deserialization performance for small types
Improved deserialization performance for case-insensitive and missing-property cases
Improved serialization performance for long JSON strings
These improvements are going to be especially meaningful for high-performance apps.

Improved performance for collections
We made significant improvements for large collections (~1.15x-1.5x on deserialize, ~1.5x-2.4x on serialize). You can see these improvements characterized in much more detail at dotnet/runtime #2259. The following numbers show performance numbers for processing collections with 1,024 elements.

Improved performance for small types (TechEmpower benchmarks)
In .NET 5.0, there was a significant effort to improve .NET performance in the TechEmpower JSON benchmark. This work spanned across multiple areas, including the networking stack, Kestrel, and JsonSerializer itself. As a result, performance when observing work done within the serializer is now ~19% better.

These changes, and the performance measurements are covered in detail at dotnet/runtime #37976. There are two sets of benchmarks there. The first is validating performance with the JsonSerializer performance benchmarks that the team maintains. There is an ~8% improvement observed. The next section is for TechEmpower. It measures three different approaches for satisfying the requirements of the TechEmpower JSON benchmark. SerializeWithCachedBufferAndWriter is the one we use in the official benchmark.

Method	Mean	Error	StdDev	Median	Min	Max	Gen 0	Gen 1	Gen 2	Allocated
SerializeWithCachedBufferAndWriter (Before)	155.3 ns	1.19 ns	1.11 ns	155.5 ns	153.3 ns	157.3 ns	0.0038	–	–	24 B
SerializeWithCachedBufferAndWriter (After) ~1.19x faster	130.8 ns	1.50 ns	1.40 ns	130.9 ns	128.6 ns	133.0 ns	0.0037	–	–	24 B
All the work done across the stack will improve the placement of .NET on the JSON TechEmpower benchmark once we update our entries to .NET 5.0. We can compare the performance of the aspcore entry of the benchmark in .NET 3.1 (Round 19, 2020-05-28) to .NET 5.0 (Unofficial continuous run, 2020-12-14):

Before

TechEmpower Before

After

TechEmpower After

We can see that the responses per second (RPS) for JSON serialization increased from 904,846 to 1,190,245, which is a ~31% improvement.

Improved deserialization performance for case-insensitive and extra-property cases
One of the most common issues with using JSON is a mismatch of naming conventions with .NET design guidelines. JSON properties are often camelCase and .NET properties and fields are typically PascalCase. The JSON serializer you use is responsible for bridging between naming conventions. That doesn’t come for free, at least not with .NET Core 3.1. That cost is now negligible with .NET 5.0.

The code that allows for case insensitivity and extra properties has been greatly improved in .NET 5.0. It is ~1.75x faster in some cases.

The following benchmarks are for a simple 4-property test class that has property names which have more than 7 characters.

3.1 performance

Improve serialization performance for long JSON strings
dotnet/corefx #41845 utilized SSE2 intrinsics to make the security check to see if a JSON string needs escaping, faster. When serializing commonly found payloads, there is a ~10-20% improvement. Also, when writing relatively large JSON strings using the writer directly, there is a ~30% improvement. The performance characteristics of this change are discussed in greater detail in this GitHub gist. One interesting data point is a benchmark that shows improvements when serializing an instance of a POCO representing a NuGet search result:

Before:

Method	Mean	Error	StdDev	Median	Min	Max	Gen 0	Gen 1	Gen 2	Allocated
SerializeNugetPayload (Before)	791.7 ms	15.69 ms	16.12 ms	787.4 ms	772.0 ms	827.1 ms	–	–	–	787.3 MB
SerializeNugetPayload (After) ~1.13x faster	698.4 ms	6.63 ms	5.53 ms	699.5 ms	690.9 ms	708.4 ms	–	–	–	787.3 MB
Breaking changes
We made a few behavioral breaking changes between .NET Core 3.x and .NET 5.0. Given that System.Text.Json is a platform component and adheres to a strict compatibility standard like the rest of .NET, these changes were made based on careful evaluation of their impacts, and serve to improve the library as a whole. Though important, these changes generally address edge cases, especially around consistency, and should have minimal impact to the vast majority of folks using the library. For more significant behavioral changes and new feature additions, we make them opt-in to avoid breaking existing code written against previous versions of the library. See the linked documents for more information on each breaking change.

Deserialization of char types requires a single-character string
ASP.NET Core apps allow deserializing quoted numbers
JsonSerializer.Serialize throws ArgumentNullException when Type parameter is null
Non-public, parameterless constructors not used for deserialization
PropertyNamingPolicy, PropertyNameCaseInsensitive, and Encoder options are honored when serializing and deserializing KeyValuePair<TKey,TValue>
What’s next for System.Text.Json?
We have started planning for .NET 6.0. We’ll continue to address the most requested features that help drive System.Text.Json to be a viable choice for a JSON stack in more .NET applications, weighing each request against our design principles. See dotnet/runtime 43620 for an overview of what is being proposed. Here is a sneak peak of some of the top features.

C# source generator for JSON serialization (dotnet/runtime #1568)
One area of investment is utilizing the new C# source generators feature to generate code that can help the serializer in the following areas:

Improved start up perf
Improved run-time throughput
Reduced private bytes usage
ILLinker friendliness due to avoiding runtime reflection
Reduced application size by facilitating linker removal of unused reflection-based code-paths of the serializer and unused converters
This effort is underway and is in a prototype stage. Action items and progress of this effort can be observed through the JSON Code Gen project board in dotnet/runtimelab.

The updated System.Text.Json with support for source generation can be consumed via an experimental NuGet package. Please share with us any performance changes you observe when using this feature. Issues can be logged here with the area-JsonCodeGen label.

Extended polymorphic serialization and deserialization (dotnet/runtime #45189)
Polymorphic serialization and deserialization remain important scenarios for modern .NET applications. We expect feature work to happen in .NET 6.0 to enable these scenarios.

dynamic and a mutable JSON DOM (dotnet/runtime #45188)
Enabling serializing and deserializing dynamic types and providing a mutable JSON document are two closely related and important features that will unblock many customers. We are tracking these as potential work items for .NET 6.0.

Miscellaneous improvements (dotnet/runtime #45190)
There are multiple miscellaneous features and improvements that we would like to make to make in .NET 6.0. Some features would be innovative and unique to System.Text.Json, such as a feature to support asynchronously serializing and deserializing IAsyncEnumerable<T> instances (dotnet/runtime #1570). Other features would be more familiar, such as adding snake_case support (dotnet/runtime #782), and being able to change the default JsonSerializerOptions settings (dotnet/runtime #31094). Implementing these features would increase the number of apps for which System.Text.Json is a good fit.

Closing
.NET 5.0 was a big release for System.Text.Json. If your project is not targeting .NET 5.0, you can still take advantage of the new improvements by installing the latest System.Text.Json NuGet package.

A lot of the work we did in .NET 5.0 was driven by the community. @YohDeadfall implemented field support and contributed various optimizations to JsonSerializer. @NikiforovAll implemented the JsonSerializerOptions constructor that takes a JsonSerializerDefaults value. @marcusturewicz implemented support for serializing and deserializing JsonDocument instances. @devsko contributed fixes to various issues with new .NET 5.0 improvements before we shipped. @CodeBlanch contributed fixes for issues with null and nullability. @Marusyk contributed a fix for a bug with reference equality for the new preserve-references feature. @khellang contributed a fix for a bug with the validation of DateTime and DateTimeOffset payloads when reading. @alanisaac, @thomaslevesque, @marcusturewicz, @madmir, @NikiforovAll, @JoshSchreuder, @Jacksondr5, and @KimKiHyuk contributed changes to improve test coverage for System.Text.Json in the continuous effort to get it close to 100%. We can’t highlight all the contributions here, but the .NET Thanks page gives kudos to all contributors to the .NET runtime.

In .NET 6.0, we’re continuing to make more improvements. Contributions to System.Text.Json are very welcome as we make progress. Simply visit this GitHub query to find issues labeled with area-System.Text.Json and up-for-grabs. If you are feeling bold, check out the issues without the up-for-grabs label. As always, feedback is very welcome, especially now as we are currently planning for the next release.
