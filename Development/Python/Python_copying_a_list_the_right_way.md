# Python: copying a list the right way

```python
new = old[:]
```

Those proficient in Python know what the previous line do. It copies the list old into new. This is confusing for beginners and should be avoided. Sadly the [:] notation is widely used, probably because most Python programmers don’t know a better way of copying lists.

## A little bit of pythonic theory

First we need to understand how Python manages objects & variables. Python doesn’t have variables like C. In C a variable is not just a name, it is a set of bits; a variable exists somewhere in memory. In Python variables are just tags attached to objects.

Consider the following statement:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
```

It means that a points to the list [1, 2, 3] we just created, but a is not the list. If we do:

```python
b = a
```

We didn’t copy the list referenced by a. We just created a new tag band attached it to the list pointed by a. Like in the picture below:

![a and b reference the same list](images/clip_image001.png)

If you modify a, you also modify b, since they point to the same list:
```python
a.append(4)
print(a)
>>> [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(b)
>>> [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The built-in function id() helps keeping track of all this. It returns the object’s unique id. This id is the object’s memory address.

```python
id(a)
>>> 3080501452L
id(b)
>>> 3080501452L
c = []  # Create a new list
id(c)
>>> 3080609228L
```

a and b really do point to the same memory address. c points to a new empty list, different from the one referenced by a and b.

## Back to our list

Now we want to copy the list referenced by a. We need to create a new list to attach b to it.

![a and b reference different lists](images/clip_image001-1546444595253.png)

That bring use back to new = old[:]. The operator [:] returns a slice of a sequence. Slicing a portion of a list: create a new list, and copy the portion of the original list into this new list.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
a[1:3][2, 3]
id(a)
>>> 3080104140L
id(a[1:3])
>>> 3080513612L
```

If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning of the list; omit the second index, it stops at the end of the list.



```python
a[:3][1, 2, 3]
a[1:][2, 3, 4]
```


By calling a[:], you get a slice of a starting from the beginning and finishing at the end. That’s a full copy of a. But it’s not the only way of copying lists. What about this one?

```python
b = list(a)
id(a)
>>> 3080104140L
id(b)
>>> 3080520556L
```

Isn’t it better, less cryptic, and more pythonic? a[:] feels a bit too much like Perl. Unlike with the slicing notation, those who don’t know Python will understand that b contains a list.
list() is the list constructor. It will construct a new list based of the passed sequence. The sequence doesn’t necessarily need to be a list, it can be any kind of sequence.

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_list = list(my_tuple)
print(my_list)
>>> [1, 2, 3]
```


And it works with generators. [:] doesn’t work on generators since they are unsubscriptable —you can’t do generator[0], for example.

```python
generator = (x * 3 for x in range(4))
list(generator)
>>> [0, 3, 6, 9]
```


90% of the time [:] could be replaced by list(). Of course it won’t work for everything since the two are not strictly equivalent, but it is worth trying. Next time you see a [:] try to replace it with list, your code should be more readable. Do it, the devil is in the details.
